<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Track Geometry Measurement System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>No Contact</li><li>Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Track Geometry Measurement System market is divided into two main types: contact and non-contact systems. Contact systems involve physical interaction with the track, using sensors or probes to directly measure parameters such as alignment, gauge, and elevation. In contrast, non-contact systems utilize technologies like lasers or high-resolution cameras to gather data without touching the track. Both types are crucial for ensuring rail safety and performance, with non-contact methods often preferred for their efficiency and reduced maintenance requirements.</p></p>
